# Static-Comp 
### Abstract:

The static comp challenge is a challenge to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Installation Instructions:

- Basic site setup with index.html and styles.css
- Create a repo on github
